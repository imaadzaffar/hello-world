# hello-world

Hello to anyone reading this,

Imaad here. As of this moment I am working on Android Studio projects and making Android apps. 
In the past I have used Python, Java and some HTML. I really like coding because I like to solve problems.
Let's see what the future holds 

Signing off for now :)
